##### v1.1.0

**breaking changes**

- `DAVClient` is no longer a type returned by `createDAVClient`, instead it's a class that can be instantiated.
- `timeRange` in `fetchCalendarObjects` is now validated against `ISO_8601` standard and invalid format will throw an error.
- typescript target changed to `es2015`, if you are on `node >= 10` and `browsers that are not IE and have been updated since 2015`, you should be fine. support for `es5` output is not possible with added `esm` support.

**features**

- added a new way to create `DAVClient` by `new DAVClient(...params)`.
- added support for `esm`.

##### improvements

- typescript checks are now with `strict` enabled, which means better types and less bugs.
- added more exports, now all internal functions are exported.
- multiple documentation improvements.

##### v1.0.6

Fixed a bug where timeRange filter sometimes might be in the wrong format.

##### v1.0.3

Fixed a bug where calendar objects with `http` in its id would cause operations on it to fail.
